<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>



I am currently Ph.D student of Computer Science at North Caroline State University. I am fortunately advised by  <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/"> Prof. Xiaorui Liu</a> . Before joining NCSU, I got my master degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="http://www.amss.ac.cn/">Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinease Academy of Sciences</a>, advised by <a href="http://wulab.ac.cn/">Lingyun Wu</a>.
I received my B.E. in Applied Mathematics at <a href="http://math.bnu.edu.cn/">Beijing Normal University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/212928.htm">Huajie Chen</a> and <a href="http://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/212930.htm">Li Cui</a>.

I was a research intern at <a href="https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University</a>,  working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0yNkmO4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Wenbing Huang</a>, exploring spatial-temporal & equivariant graph neural networks.


I'm interested in Adversarial Robustness and Graph Neural Networks.
I am a big fan of basketball 🏀 and I idolize Chris Paul and Allen Iverson. Our team won two champions in basketball match in BNU.
